**Briefly About Myself:**

At university I was interested in programming, but the subject was only in C++. which I didn't really like.
 
So I decided to try my hand at Frontend.         
It's easy for me to work in Git Bash, because my previous job was setting up access networks, so this interface is familiar and convenient to me.

Working as a developer attracts me because you can create incredible things and the constant development of technologies and materials gives unlimited opportunities for self-development.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Front end Developer.

**Skills and Proficiency:**
- HTML (novice)
- C++ (novice)
- Comouter Networks (novice)
  
**Code example:**

**Task:**

***Write a function that do sum of two numbers***
```
function sum(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
```
